            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p align="justify">I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from CMR Technical Campus, Hyderabad. With a solid educational foundation, I have developed a strong interest in software development and data analysis, aspiring to contribute to innovative research and cutting-edge technology. My academic journey began with a Diploma in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Jyothishmathi Institute of Technology & Science, Karimnagar, where I gained a deeper understanding of electronics and communication systems.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout my studies, I have acquired a diverse skill set that spans various programming languages, data analysis techniques, and hands-on experience with emerging technologies. I am proficient in Python, HTML/CSS, basic Java, and C language, enabling me to develop robust software solutions. My data analysis capabilities are enhanced by my knowledge of SQL and MS Excel, which I use to interpret and visualize complex data sets. Additionally, I have gained practical experience with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which has further fueled my passion for integrating smart systems into everyday applications.</p>

<p align="justify">My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in my completion of several industry-recognized certifications. I have earned a Python Certification of Completion by Kaggle, which has strengthened my programming skills, and I have also completed the Career Essentials in Software Development certification by Microsoft, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of software development practices. Furthermore, I have obtained both introductory and intermediate machine learning certifications from Kaggle, equipping me with the knowledge to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems.</p>

<p align="justify">I have also actively participated in workshops and industrial training to enhance my practical knowledge. At Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), a Government of India enterprise, I successfully completed industrial training focused on telecom services, where I gained insights into the operations of one of Indiaâ€™s largest telecommunications providers. My enthusiasm for IoT technology led me to participate in national workshops on the Internet of Things (IoT) and IoT using NodeMCU, where I learned about the latest developments in this field and how to apply them in practical scenarios.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition to my academic and training experiences, I have worked on several projects that demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges. One of my key projects involved developing an algorithm for credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. This project aimed to address the growing problem of credit card fraud in the financial industry by enhancing the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to improve predictive accuracy and reliability. Another significant project was the creation of a smart security system with speech recognition using IoT technology. This project combined advanced security features with speech recognition capabilities, resulting in a sophisticated system that enhances user convenience while providing robust protection against unauthorized access.</p>

<p align="justify">As I embark on my professional journey, I am eager to apply my skills, knowledge, and enthusiasm to a dynamic team where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow in the ever-evolving field of software development and data analysis. I am passionate about making a positive impact through technology and am excited about the opportunities ahead.</p>
